# Serverless Workflow Specification - Java SDK

Provides the Java API/SPI and Model Validation for the [Serverless Workflow Specification](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification)

With the SDK you can:

* Parse workflow JSON and YAML definitions
* Programmatically build workflow definitions
* Validate workflow definitions (both schema and workflow integrity validation)
* Generate workflow diagram (SVG)
* Set of utilities to help runtimes interpret the Serverless Workflow object model

Serverless Workflow Java SDK is **not** a workflow runtime implementation but can be used by Java runtime implementations
to parse and validate workflow definitions as well as generate the workflow diagram (SVG).

### How to Use 

#### Creating from JSON/YAML source

You can create a Workflow instance from JSON/YAML source:

Let's say you have a simple YAML based workflow definition:

```yaml
id: greeting
version: '1.0'
name: Greeting Workflow
start: Greet
description: Greet Someone
functions:
  - name: greetingFunction
    operation: file://myapis/greetingapis.json#greeting
states:
- name: Greet
  type: operation
  actions:
  - functionRef:
      refName: greetingFunction
      arguments:
        name: "${ .greet.name }"
    actionDataFilter:
      results: "${ .payload.greeting }"
  stateDataFilter:
    output: "${ .greeting }"
  end: true
```

To parse it and create a Workflow instance you can do:

``` java
Workflow workflow = Workflow.fromSource(source);
```

where 'source' is the above mentioned YAML definition.

The fromSource static method can take in definitions in both JSON and YAML formats.

Once you have the Workflow instance you can use its API to inspect it, for example:

``` java
assertNotNull(workflow);
assertEquals("greeting", workflow.getId());
assertEquals("Greeting Workflow", workflow.getName());

assertNotNull(workflow.getFunctions());
assertEquals(1, workflow.getFunctions().size());
assertEquals("greetingFunction", workflow.getFunctions().get(0).getName());

assertNotNull(workflow.getStates());
assertEquals(1, workflow.getStates().size());
assertTrue(workflow.getStates().get(0) instanceof OperationState);

OperationState operationState = (OperationState) workflow.getStates().get(0);
assertEquals("Greet", operationState.getName());
assertEquals(DefaultState.Type.OPERATION, operationState.getType());
...
```

#### Using builder API

You can also programmatically create Workflow instances, for example:

``` java
Workflow workflow = new Workflow()
                .withId("test-workflow")
                .withName("test-workflow-name")
                .withVersion("1.0")
                .withStart(new Start().withStateName("MyDelayState"))
                .withFunctions(new Functions(Arrays.asList(
                        new FunctionDefinition().withName("testFunction")
                                .withOperation("testSwaggerDef#testOperationId")))
                )
                .withStates(Arrays.asList(
                        new DelayState().withName("MyDelayState").withType(DELAY)
                                .withTimeDelay("PT1M")
                                .withEnd(
                                        new End().withTerminate(true)
                                )
                        )
                );
```

This will create a test workflow that defines an event, a function and a single Delay State.

You can use the workflow instance to get its JSON/YAML definition as well:

``` java
assertNotNull(Workflow.toJson(testWorkflow));
assertNotNull(Workflow.toYaml(testWorkflow));
```

#### Using Workflow Validation

Validation allows you to perform Json Schema validation against the JSON/YAML workflow definitions.
Once you have a `Workflow` instance, you can also run integrity checks.

You can validate a Workflow JSON/YAML definition to get validation errors:

``` java
WorkflowValidator workflowValidator = new WorkflowValidatorImpl();
List<ValidationError> validationErrors = workflowValidator.setSource("WORKFLOW_MODEL_JSON/YAML").validate();
```

Where `WORKFLOW_MODEL_JSON/YAML` is the actual workflow model JSON or YAML definition.

Or you can just check if it is valid (without getting specific errors):

``` java
WorkflowValidator workflowValidator = new WorkflowValidatorImpl();
boolean isValidWorkflow = workflowValidator.setSource("WORKFLOW_MODEL_JSON/YAML").isValid();
```

If you build your Workflow programmatically, you can validate it as well:

``` java
Workflow workflow = new Workflow()
                .withId("test-workflow")
                .withVersion("1.0")
                .withStart(new Start().withStateName("MyDelayState"))
                .withStates(Arrays.asList(
                        new DelayState().withName("MyDelayState").withType(DefaultState.Type.DELAY)
                                .withTimeDelay("PT1M")
                                .withEnd(
                                        new End().withTerminate(true)
                                )
                ));
);

WorkflowValidator workflowValidator = new WorkflowValidatorImpl();
List<ValidationError> validationErrors = workflowValidator.setWorkflow(workflow).validate();
```

#### Building Workflow Diagram

Given a valid workflow definition (JSON/YAML) or a Workflow object you can build the workflow diagram SVG.
The generated diagram SVG uses [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) state diagram visualization and can be embedded inside your 
tooling or web pages, or any SVG viewer.

You can build the workflow diagram SVG with the following code:

``` java
Workflow workflow = Workflow.fromSource(source);

WorkflowDiagram workflowDiagram = new WorkflowDiagramImpl();
workflowDiagram.setWorkflow(workflow);

String diagramSVG = workflowDiagram.getSvgDiagram();
```

`diagramSVG` includes the diagram SVG source which you can then decide to save to a file, 
print, or process further.

In case default visualization of the workflow is not sufficient you can provide custom workflow template to be 
used while generating the SVG file. Easiest is to start off from the default template and customize it to your needs.

Custom template must be on the classpath in `templates/plantuml` directory and must use `.txt` extension. Next
template is set on `WorkflowDiagram` instance as shown below.

``` java
Workflow workflow = Workflow.fromSource(source);

WorkflowDiagram workflowDiagram = new WorkflowDiagramImpl();
workflowDiagram.setWorkflow(workflow);
workflowDiagram.setTemplate("custom-template");

String diagramSVG = workflowDiagram.getSvgDiagram();
```

By default the diagram legend is now shown. If you want to enable it you can do:

``` java
Workflow workflow = Workflow.fromSource(source);

WorkflowDiagram workflowDiagram = new WorkflowDiagramImpl();
workflowDiagram.setWorkflow(workflow)
               .showLegend(true);

String diagramSVG = workflowDiagram.getSvgDiagram();
```

Here are some generated diagrams from the specification examples (with legend enabled):

#### Using Workflow Utils
Workflow utils provide a number of useful methods for extracting information from workflow definitions.
Once you have a `Workflow` instance, you can use it
##### Get Starting State
```Java
State startingState = WorkflowUtils.getStartingState(workflow);
```
##### Get States by State Type
```Java
    List<State> states = WorkflowUtils.getStates(workflow, DefaultState.Type.EVENT);
```
##### Get Consumed-Events, Produced-Events and their count
```Java
 List<EventDefinition> consumedEvents = WorkflowUtils.getWorkflowConsumedEvents(workflow);
 int consumedEventsCount = WorkflowUtils.getWorkflowConsumedEventsCount(workflow);

 List<EventDefinition> producedEvents = WorkflowUtils.getWorkflowProducedEvents(workflow);
 int producedEventsCount = WorkflowUtils.getWorkflowProducedEventsCount(workflow);
 ```
##### Get Defined Consumed-Events, Defined Produced-Events and their count
```Java
 List<EventDefinition> consumedEvents = WorkflowUtils.getWorkflowConsumedEventsCount(workflow);
 int consumedEventsCount = WorkflowUtils.getWorkflowConsumedEventsCount(workflow);

 List<EventDefinition> producedEvents = WorkflowUtils.getWorkflowProducedEvents(workflow);
 int producedEventsCount = WorkflowUtils.getWorkflowProducedEventsCount(workflow);
 ```
##### Get Function definitions which is used by an action
```Java
FunctionDefinition finalizeApplicationFunctionDefinition =
        WorkflowUtils.getFunctionDefinitionsForAction(workflow, "finalizeApplicationAction");
```
##### Get Actions which uses a Function definition
```Java
 List<Action> actionsForFunctionDefinition =
        WorkflowUtils.getActionsForFunctionDefinition(workflow, functionRefName);
```

#### Extra

SDK includes extra functionalities which are not part of core modules but 
are very useful and can be used as addons to the core:

##### Diagram REST
This is a Spring Boot app which builds a rest api for diagram generation. 
It was contributed by our community member David Marques.

To start using it:

```
cd diagram-rest
mvn clean install spring-boot:run
```

Then you can get the diagram SVG for a workflow definition for example:

```
curl -X POST localhost:8090/diagram -d '{"id":"booklending","name":"Book Lending Workflow","version":"1.0","specVersion":"0.8","start":"Book Lending Request","states":[{"name":"Book Lending Request","type":"event","onEvents":[{"eventRefs":["Book Lending Request Event"]}],"transition":"Get Book Status"},{"name":"Get Book Status","type":"operation","actions":[{"functionRef":{"refName":"Get status for book","arguments":{"bookid":"${ .book.id }"}}}],"transition":"Book Status Decision"},{"name":"Book Status Decision","type":"switch","dataConditions":[{"name":"Book is on loan","condition":"${ .book.status == \"onloan\" }","transition":"Report Status To Lender"},{"name":"Check is available","condition":"${ .book.status == \"available\" }","transition":"Check Out Book"}]},{"name":"Report Status To Lender","type":"operation","actions":[{"functionRef":{"refName":"Send status to lender","arguments":{"bookid":"${ .book.id }","message":"Book ${ .book.title } is already on loan"}}}],"transition":"Wait for Lender response"},{"name":"Wait for Lender response","type":"switch","eventConditions":[{"name":"Hold Book","eventRef":"Hold Book Event","transition":"Request Hold"},{"name":"Decline Book Hold","eventRef":"Decline Hold Event","transition":"Cancel Request"}]},{"name":"Request Hold","type":"operation","actions":[{"functionRef":{"refName":"Request hold for lender","arguments":{"bookid":"${ .book.id }","lender":"${ .lender }"}}}],"transition":"Wait two weeks"},{"name":"Wait two weeks","type":"sleep","duration":"P2W","transition":"Get Book Status"},{"name":"Check Out Book","type":"operation","actions":[{"functionRef":{"refName":"Check out book with id","arguments":{"bookid":"${ .book.id }"}}},{"functionRef":{"refName":"Notify Lender for checkout","arguments":{"bookid":"${ .book.id }","lender":"${ .lender }"}}}],"end":true}],"functions":[],"events":[]}'
```
